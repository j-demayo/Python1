They did this after discovering that the initial trial had several issues, including unreliable data recording and poor participant selection. In order to prove the efficacy of their drug, they created fake data. When asked for additional data, they attempted to generate more fake datasets, and also included the original poor-quality dataset several times in order to make the trials seem more realistic.\n",
